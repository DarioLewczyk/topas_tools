# Topas Tools

The TOPAS Tools package is written to help with the heavy lifting of making figures and working with output files and metadata files from your beamline experiments. 

Some of the primary features of TOPAS Tools are: 

* parsing metadata files
* pairing metadata files with their corresponding integrated data files
* parsing the .out files from TOPAS
* parsing so-called '.hkli' files generated by TOPAS
* parsing TOPAS C-matrices
* simplifying automated Rietveld refinement procedures
* parsing CSV output from TOPAS
* parsing .xy file output from TOPAS with x, yobs, ycalc, ydiff columns
* plotting results of Rietveld refinements

In addition to niche-case tools, TOPAS tools also offers a host of generally useful tools for making nice command line tools and much more.
